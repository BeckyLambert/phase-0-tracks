What sorts of resources will help? 
Hello Google! I'll be looking for cheatsheets, blog posts, and Stack over flow is usually a safe bet as well as w3schools which is quickly becoming one of my favorite resources. 

How often should you stop and test what you just learned? 
Very often, I like to test out what I'm learning as I learn it so that I can remember it better. 

Are breaks important? 
YES! There comes a point if you dont take a break that you just hit a wall and all the words on the screen become one long blur. Can't really learn anything when that happens. I like to take breaks usually every hour. Take the dog for a walk, or just do something that gives my mind and eyes a break in general so that I can come back to the assignment with "new eyes".

Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.
Allll the research, within the timeboxed amount of time of course. Usually going over a cheat sheet and picking a few things that look interesting and trying them out is the best way to go for me. 

Release 1:
