What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
 Linux never assumes that the user is incompetent. It always assumes you know what you are doing and allows you do do anything you tell it to. It treats everyone equally and allows everyone the maximum amount of power. The Linux philosophy is epitomized by the ease with which one can open a terminal emulator to access the CLI and its concomitant power.

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
A VPS is basically a remote computer that can run any software a normal computer can. The only difference is that a VPS is cloud based and well, a laptop isnt. From what I can tell the biggest advantage to a VPS is that if you mess something up or as was mentioned accidentally use a linux command you definitely should not have used you can simply delete the one you were working on and recreate it. 

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

Root in linux is the "super user", it is the user that can access any part of the program at any time and makes it easier to hack. Creating seperate Linux users to work on the program is kind of like creating a checkout branch when working on a Ruby program. It's safer if you make a mistake and can be deleted once the program is completed.
