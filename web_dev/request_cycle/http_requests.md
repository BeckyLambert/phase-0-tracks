What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?
GET requests data from a specified resource while POST submits data to be processed to a specific resource. It seems POST is the more secure of the two. Like when having to resubmit s webpage POST will confirm with the user their decision to reload while GET will just reload. POST should be used more for sensitive information while GET should not be used because data sent is part of the URL.


Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests
A cookie is a small text file that is stored by a browser on the userâ€™s machine. Cookies are plain text; they contain no executable code. 
Cookies are passed as HTTP headers, both in the request (client -> server), and in the response (server -> client).
