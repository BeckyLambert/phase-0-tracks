# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
# Version control is a repository of files that can be tracked. It is useful because you can find exactly where changes need to be made when working on programs.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
# A branch is a copy of your code in a seperate area that you can modify on its own without the changes being tracked. You would use one to work on code without messing up the entire project. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
# A commit is a statement in the code letting others know what changes have been made. A good commit would be what changes were made in detail and when they were made. 

* What is a merge conflict?
# A merge conflict is when your current branch and the branch you want to merge have diverged. You have commits in your current branch which are not in the other and vise versa.
