<!-- semantic elements are used to make the code more readable. I think so far the nav is most useful.
The browser reads the code from top to bottom so however you arrange it is what will be read first.
We learned about making our own snippets. I definitely plan on using them more later on, I think the more we use them the easier it will be to understand them.
My biggest challenge was figuring out how the snippets work. I'm still a little fuzzy on it, but as stated above the more I use them the more I'll figure it out. The code was a bit unfamiliar, but my pair and guide were great for helping me through it and answering questions.
